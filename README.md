# Steam item search between friends
This extension allows to find items you looking for in all friends inventories on the same time.(On steam friends page e.g. http://steamcommunity.com/my/friends)

## Extension allows filtering results like:

 * **Quality** - Unique, Limited, Genuine, Vintage, Unusual, Heroic, etc..

## **How To:** Find appid and contextid for game items you looking for.
 1. Open any inventory in chrome.
 2. Select game inventory that you need. (for example, "Steam" inventory)
 3. Choose items category if you need to. (for example, "Coupons")
 4. Refresh or open now steam friends page in chrome.
